// Advantages:
// Component-Based Architecture: React encourages building applications with reusable components, making code organization and maintenance easier.

//Virtual DOM:React uses a virtual representation of the DOM, allowing for efficient updates and rendering, leading to better performance.

// JSX:This syntax extension allows developers to write HTML-like structures within JavaScript, making UI development more intuitive.

// Large Community:React has a vibrant community, providing extensive support, libraries, and tools.

// SEO-Friendly:React can render on the server-side, making it easier for search engines to crawl and index web applications.

// Easy to Learn: React has a relatively low learning curve, especially for developers familiar with JavaScript.

// Cross-Platform Development: React Native allows developers to build mobile apps using React, sharing code and expertise between web and mobile development.


// Disadvantages:

//Search Engine Optimization: very low because page does not reloads again and again

// Fast-Paced Development:React's ecosystem evolves rapidly, requiring developers to stay updated and adapt to changes.

// Lack of Conventions:React provides flexibility in structuring applications, which can lead to inconsistencies if not managed properly.

// View-Only Library: React focuses solely on the UI layer, requiring additional libraries for routing, state management, and other functionalities.

// JSX as a Barrier:Some developers find JSX syntax unfamiliar and prefer using template-based approaches.

// Potential for Over-Engineering: The component-based architecture can lead to over-engineering in smaller projects.
